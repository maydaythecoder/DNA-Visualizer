# DNA Visualizer

## Description

DNA Visualizer is a simple program made in pycharm that visually represents DNA sequences using ASCII art. It randomly generates nucleotide pairs and displays them in a stylized format.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. The program will display a visual representation of random DNA sequences.
3. Press `Ctrl-C` to quit the program.

## Configuration

You can modify the script by adjusting the following parameters in the `main.py` file:

- `PAUSE`: Controls the time delay between each visual representation.
- `ROWS`: ASCII art representation of the DNA visualizer.

## Dependencies

The script relies on the following Python modules:

- `random`: Used for random nucleotide selection.
- `sys`: Used for handling system-related operations.
- `time`: Used for introducing delays in the visualization.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the beauty of DNA structure.
